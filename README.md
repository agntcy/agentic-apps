# AGNTCY: Agentic Applications Collection

Welcome to the AGNTCY's Agentic Applications Collection! This repository contains a diverse set of applications built using agent-based architectures and the Agent Connect Protocol (ACP). Each application demonstrates different aspects of agent-based computing and AI integration.

## 🚀 Projects Overview

This repository contains several independent agentic applications:

1. **Weather Vibes AGP** - A weather-based agent application demonstrating the Agent Connect Protocol implementation
2. **Remote Agent AGP** - A framework for managing and interacting with remote agents
3. **Network of Assistants** - A collaborative network of AI assistants working together
4. **Marketing Campaign** - An agent-based marketing campaign management system
5. **Mail Composer** - An intelligent email composition assistant
6. **Email Reviewer** - An AI-powered email review and analysis tool

## 🤖 Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)

The [Agent Connect Protocol (ACP)](https://agntcy.org/) is a standardized protocol that enables seamless communication between different AI agents, regardless of their implementation or location. ACP provides:

- **Standardized Communication**: A common language for agent interactions
- **Flexible Authentication**: Support for various authentication schemes
- **Multiple Execution Modes**: Synchronous, asynchronous, and streaming capabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Standardized ways to configure and manage agents
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error definitions and handling mechanisms
- **Schema Definitions**: Clear specifications for input, output, and configuration formats

Key ACP Features:
- **Agent Discovery**: Find and connect with available agents
- **Thread Management**: Handle conversational state and context
- **Interrupt Handling**: Support for agent interruptions and resumptions
- **Streaming Support**: Real-time partial results delivery
- **Cross-Framework Compatibility**: Enables agents built with different frameworks to communicate

For more detailed information about ACP, visit the [official documentation](https://docs.agntcy.org/).
