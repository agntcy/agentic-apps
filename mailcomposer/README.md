# Email Composer Agent

The Email Composer Agent is a demonstration AI agent developed with LangGraph, designed to assist in the composition of emails. 
It gathers necessary email details through ongoing user engagement in a chat format until the user affirms that the email is complete. Subsequently, it delivers the finalized email text.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following:

- **Azure OpenAI API Key**
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Poetry**
