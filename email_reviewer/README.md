# Email Reviewer

The Email Reviewer Agent is a demonstration AI agent developed with Llama-index, designed to review email to address a specific target audience.

The main workflow is defined in [email_reviewer.py](email_reviewer/email_reviewer.py).

## Requirements

- [Agent Workflow Server](https://docs.agntcy.org/pages/agws/workflow_server_manager.html#installation)
- **Azure OpenAI API Key or OpenAI API Key**
- **Python 3.9 or higher**
- **Poetry**

## Testing the Email Reviewer Locally

Install dependencies:

```
poetry env activate
poetry install
```

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and set the environment variables.

Fill in the `AZURE*` variables if you want to use Azure OpenAI, otherwise fill in the `OPENAI*` variables. Comment out the variables you don't want to use.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Test the agent (This will generate a review for the email defined in the `main()` function):

```
python email_reviewer/email_reviewer.py
```
